Question 1
Write a JavaScript program to display the reading status (i.e. display book name, author name,
and reading status) of the following books.
var library = [
{
author: 'Bill Gates',
title: 'The Road Ahead',
readingStatus: true
},
{
author: 'Steve Jobs',
title: 'Walter Isaacson',
readingStatus: true
},
{
author: 'Suzanne Collins',
title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games',
readingStatus: false
}];

The output should look like this:
Already read 'Bill Gates' by The Road Ahead.
Already read 'Steve Jobs' by Walter Isaacson.
You still need to read 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games' by Suzanne
Collins.

CODE-

console.log("Question 1:-")
var library = [
    {
    author: 'Bill Gates',
    title: 'The Road Ahead',
    readingStatus: true
    },
    {
    author: 'Steve Jobs',
    title: 'Walter Isaacson',
    readingStatus: true
    },
    {
    author: 'Suzanne Collins',
    title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games',
    readingStatus: false
    }];

    for(var i=0;i<library.length;i++){
        if(library[i].readingStatus){
            console.log("Already read "+library[i].author+" by "+library[i].title)
        }
       else{
            console.log("You still need to read "+library[i].author+" by "+library[i].title)
        }
    }
